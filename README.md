Hello! I'm Samuel Zormeister (better known as just Zormeister), a guy on the internet who makes stuff in C++ or C (and sometimes branches out).


I work on some pretty cool stuff! Take a look at:
- [DarwinBoot](https://github.com/samuelfzormeiser/DarwinBoot), a (really, really) work-in-progress XNU bootloader
- [My XNU branches](https://github.com/samuelfzormeiser/xnu), consisting of an x86 and ARM development branch, and a mainline branch to go with them.
- [The corecrypto project](https://github.com/samuelfzormeiser/corecrypto)
- My efforts in working on [PureDarwin](https://github.com/PureDarwin/PureDarwin)
- [PDACPIPlatform](https://github.com/PureDarwin/PDACPIPlatform), an ACPI Platform Expert kext for PureDarwin
- [iBridged](https://github.com/Carnations-Botanica/iBridged), a patcking kext for Apple Secure Boot enabled Hackintoshes to OTA on Sonoma 14.4+
- [EmbeddedDeviceMap](https://github.com/samuelfzormeiser/EmbeddedDeviceMap), an open-source reimplementation of Apple's `embedded_device_map` internal tool, forked from [this version](https://github.com/b-man/edm) and tweaked for convenient mapping
- The [IOAHCI](https://github.com/samuelfzormeiser/IOAHCIProject) project, an open-source AHCI driver and IOKit family for PureDarwin.

If you'd like to support my endeavours/batshit crazy ideas, support me on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/samzormeister)!
